# KMeansClusteringExample

This is an example implementation of the KMeans Clustering algorithm done on python, I provide my code and the dataset used.

Here is the prompt of the assignment:

a) For each k = 1,2,...,12 compute the mean SSE, which we denote μk and the sample standard deviation of SSE, which we denote σk, over all 25 clustering runs for that value of k. Generate a line plot of the mean SSE (μk) as a function of k. Include error bars that indicate the 95% confidence interval: (μk − 2σk to μk +2σk).

b) Produce a table containing the 4 columns: k, μk, μk − 2σk and μk + 2σk for each of the values of k = 1,2,...,12.
